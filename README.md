# Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Efficacy Table using R
PFS can de defined as the time from randomisation/ initiation of treatament to disease progression or death from any cause. In most solid tumor oncology trials, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is used as the primary endpoint. Since PFS involves time-to-event anylysis, we use ADTTE (Time-to-Event) ADaM dataset. Basic principles of Survival Analysis such as censoring, hazard and survival functions will play a big role in generating our PFS Efficacy table. Therefore, familiarity with Survival Analysis is required!

## Overview
 

We need to get the Kaplan-Meier median progression-free survival (PFS) and 95% C.I
